\begin{abstract}

Several known stellar streams and over-densities in the Milky Way halo --- such
as the so-called Triangulum-Andromeda, Monoceros ring, Galactic Anticenter
Stellar Structure, and A13 --- have relatively low Galactic latitudes,
relatively metal-rich stellar populations, and disk-like chemical abundance
patterns.
These results have therefore been used to suggest that the stars in these
features originated in the Milky Way disk and were ``kicked out'' through
dynamical perturbations from satellite galaxies.
However, their extreme heights above the Galactic mid-plane (up to $\sim
10~\kpc$) have raised questions about the plausibility of this scenario.
Using kinematic measurements from the \gaia\ mission, we show that giant stars
previously identified as probable members of these structures have disk-like
kinematics.
This confirms the origin of these features as having come from the Galactic
disk and suggests...

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The stellar halo around the Milky Way is full of spatial and kinematic
substructures \citep[e.g.,][]{TODO}.
The discovery of the vast majority of these structures in the Milky Way halo was
enabled by wide-field, multi-band photometry surveys like the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey \cite[SDSS;][]{TODO}, Two Micron All-Sky Survey \citep[2MASS;][]{TODO},
Pan-STARRS \citep[PS1;][]{TODO}, and the Dark Energy Survey
\citep[DES;][]{TODO}.
For example, the long tidal tails of known globular clusters such as the Palomar
5 stream \citep{TODO}, long, thin, orphaned structures such as the GD-1 stream
\citep{Grillmair:2006}, and dwarf galaxy streams such as
the Orphan stream \citep{TODO} were all identified using some combination
of these surveys.
Detailed maps of stellar number counts from these surveys have also revealed the
existence of amorphous stellar structures that typically span hundreds of square
degrees on the sky.
Subsequent follow-up of such structures, for example the Triangulum-Andromeda
stellar clouds \citep[TriAnd;][]{TODO}, the Monoceros ring or Galactic
Anticenter Stellar Structure \citep[Mon/GASS;][]{TODO}, and A13 \citep{TODO},
revealed that stars in these structures tend to have similar metallicities and
display coherent but higher dispersion internal kinematics as inferred from
line-of-sight velocities \citep[e.g.,][]{Sheffield:TODO, Li:TODO}.
From their observed properties (mainly their spatial distribution on the sky),
Milky Way halo substructures are therefore typically classified into two broad
morphological classes: ``streams'' --- long, relatively thin structures that
exhibit coherent motion --- or ``blobs'' --- physically amorphous, less
kinematically-coherent stellar over-densities.
Importantly, however, recent evidence has shown that these classes do not
uniquely map on to formation scenarios.

Most of the known stellar streams are characterized as having metal poor stellar
populations and are thus likely remnants of fully-disrupted or currently
disrupting dwarf galaxies and globular clusters \citep{TODO}.
Likewise, some diffuse stellar structures at high Galactic latitudes --- e.g.,
the Hercules-Aquila cloud \citep{TODO} or the Virgo over-density \citep{TODO}
--- are metal poor and may be ``shell''-like features that are seen around
external galaxies \citep[e.g.,][]{Kado-Fong:TODO}, though here viewed from the
inside.
The joint existence of these stellar substructures and bound stellar satellites
in the Galactic halo therefore appear to confirm the hierarchical nature of
galaxy growth, an important test of cosmological models \citep{Bullock:TODO,
TODO}.

On the other hand, several lines of evidence have recently suggested that a
number of low-latitude stream- and blob-like features may have instead
originated from the Galactic disk rather than from an accreted system itself:
\begin{description}
    \item[Spatial distribution]
        Along some sightlines toward the outer galaxy, Mon/GASS and other
        structures appears to display an oscillatory pattern, over-dense above
        the Galactic plane at some distances and below the plane at intermediate
        distances \citep[e.g.,][]{Newberg:2002, Xu:2015, TODO}.
        Stream-like features such as the Eastern Banded Structure
        \citep[EBS;][]{TODO} and the Anti-Center Stream \citep[ACS;][]{TODO}
        visually appear to emanate from the Galactic disk \citep[e.g., see
        Figure~XX and text in ][]{Slater:TODO}.
    \item[Stellar populations]
        TriAnd, Mon/GASS, and A13 all appear to have relatively metal-rich
        stellar populations, as evidenced by their lack of RR Lyrae-type stars
        and abundance of more metal-rich giant stars \citep{Price-Whelan:2015,
        Sheffield:TODO}.
    \item[Chemical abundances]
        Detailed chemical abundance measurements of giant stars in TriAnd and
        A13 have shown that the abundance patterns of these structures are more
        consistent with an extrapolation of the outer Milky Way disk rather than
        any of the known dwarf galaxies \citep{Bergemann:2018, Hayes:2018}.
    \item[Kinematics]
        \todo{ACS and Mon/GASS: Kinematics of Monoceros from Gaia DR1 - Belokurov group \citep{deBoer:2018}, rotating like disk.}
        TriAnd, Mon/GASS, and A13 seem to form a coherent kinematic trend in
        line-of-sight velocity as a function of Galactic longitude \citep{TODO,
        Johnston:2017}, however, full-space motions of stars in TriAnd and A13
        have not yet been studied.
\end{description}
If confirmed, this .. exciting prospect because they trace ... Galactoseismology
... reconstruct history of interaction and dark matter properties around disk...
\citep[e.g.,][]{Chakrabarti:TODO, Laporte:TODO}.

\citep[for a recent review, see][]{Johnston:2017}.

Here we combine astrometry from \gaia\ with previously measured line-of-sight
velocities to study the 3D kinematics of giant stars associated with the TriAnd
and A13 structures.
